      <p>Hey Tara,
<br><br>
Wishing you a day as bright as your smile, filled with laughter and joy. 🌟 Another year around the sun, and you're shining even brighter!
<br><br>
Today's the day when the stars twinkle extra, just for you. 🌠 May your dreams take flight like a paper lantern, reaching heights you never thought possible. 🎈
<br><br>
Remember, age is just a number – your spirit remains forever youthful. 🌻 So, go ahead and blow out those candles, making the world a little brighter with your wishes. 🕯️
<br><br>
Sending you a virtual hug across the miles, and hoping your day is as fabulous as you are. Cheers to the memories we've made and those yet to come!
<br><br>
Happy Birthday, Tara! 🎉🥳
<br><br>
With love and laughter,<br>
